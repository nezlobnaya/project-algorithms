#  Write a function that takes:

#     a list of unsorted_scores
#     the highest_possible_score in the game

# and returns a sorted list of scores in less than O(nlg⁡n)O(n\lg{n})O(nlgn) time.

# For example:



def sort_scores(unsorted_scores, highest_possible_score):
    # List of 0s at indices 0..highest_possible_score
    score_counts = [0] * (highest_possible_score+1)

    # Populate score_counts
    for score in unsorted_scores:
        score_counts[score] += 1

    # Populate the final sorted list
    sorted_scores = []

    # For each item in score_counts
    for score in range(len(score_counts) - 1, -1, -1):
        count = score_counts[score]

        # For the number of times the item occurs
        for time in range(count):
            # Add it to the sorted list
            sorted_scores.append(score)

    return sorted_scores


unsorted_scores = [37, 89, 41, 65, 91, 53]
HIGHEST_POSSIBLE_SCORE = 100

# Returns [91, 89, 65, 53, 41, 37]
print(sort_scores(unsorted_scores, HIGHEST_POSSIBLE_SCORE))
